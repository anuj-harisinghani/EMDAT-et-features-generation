Recording.py Function: read_rest_pupil_sizes
It currently casts the pupil sizes to integers, rather than floats. It also crashes if nonAlphanumeric characters are in the PID or in the Scene names. 

The code should look like this:

def read_rest_pupil_sizes(rpsfile):
    """
    Returns a dictionary of rest pupil sizes for all scenes if rpsfile is provided. None otherwise
    The input file has the following format:
        pid\t<scene name 1>\t<scene name 2>....\n
        <pid 1>\t<rest pupil size 1>\t<rest pupil size 2>

    Args:
        rpsfile: a string containing the name of the '.tsv' file
            with rest pupil sizes for all partiicpants and all scenes.

    Returns:
        a dictionary of rest pupil sizes. None otherwise

    """
    
    
    if rpsfile != None:
        with open(rpsfile, 'r') as f:
            lines = f.readlines()
        rpsdic = {}
        import re
        scenelist = lines[0][:-1].split('\t')
        for line in lines[1:]:
            linelist = line[:-1].split('\t')
            pid = cast_int(linelist[0])
            if pid == None: #if casting didn't work
                pid = linelist[0]
            rpsdic[pid] = {}
            for scene, rpsvalue in zip(scenelist[1:], linelist[1:]):
                rpsdic[pid][scene] = cast_float(rpsvalue)

        return rpsdic
    else:
        return None
